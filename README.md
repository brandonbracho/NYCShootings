## Introduction 
This project is part EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and part predcitive modeling using the Historic Shooting Incidents and Year to Date Shooting Incidents dataset from NYC's Open Data site. Inspiration for this project ensued in light of the media frenzy that is surrounding the rise of gun violence in New York City. Do the numbers match the hype? Questions that are addressed within the project include:
- What are the overall trends in shootings, along with yearly, monthly and hours trends.
- What factors play a role in the sheer number of daily shootings and could these factors help a preditive model perform better?
- Where do most shootings in NYC occur?
- What are trends seen in the demographics of perpetrators of shootings along with the victims?
- How many total shootings might NYC see in the year of 2021?
